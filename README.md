# FileDetailsAndComparison
<b>Tests</b></br>
This script accepts exactly two arguments of absolute file paths to an ordinary file. First, a series of tests are completed to ensure that two different file names are provided, the files exist, that the files are ordinary files, and the user running the script has read access to both files.

<b>File Details</b></br>
Retrieves, stores, and prints the following details for both files:
- The file name
- The file size in bytes
- The file permissions
- A guess about the file contents
- The number of words

<b>Comparison</b></br>

- File size in bytes
- The number of words.
